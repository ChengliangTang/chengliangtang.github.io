I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University in New York, advised by Prof. Tian Zheng. In 2016 I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Tsinghua University.

I am broadly interested in applied statistics and machine learning. I work on weakly supervised learning and functional data analysis, including their applications in environmental studies, medical research, etc. I am also very interested in the related fields of survival analysis and deep learning.
