I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](http://stat.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in New York, advised by Prof. [Tian Zheng](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/). In 2016 I received a B.S. in [Mathematics](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

I am broadly interested in applied statistics and machine learning. I work on weakly supervised learning and functional data analysis, including their applications in environmental studies, medical research, etc. I am also very interested in the related fields of survival analysis and deep learning.
